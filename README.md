## SimpleFastPhysicsSandbox

###About

This is a simple phsyics sandbox written in C++ using [SFML 2.1](http://www.sfml-dev.org). The physics part is handled by [Box2D v2.3.0](http://box2d.org). [SFGUI v0.2.0](http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de) library has also been used for the user interface. This sandbox gives user the capability to create rectangles, disks, and rectangular fixtures of different sizes. Gravity can be changed using the slider. Right-click destroys the selected object, whereas spacebar pauses the sandbox.
